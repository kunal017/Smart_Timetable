# Smart_timetable
A problem which every institution faces at the start of an academic year is designing a time-table which can satisfy needs of every student/teacher without having any clashes. So, we are trying to develop an app based solution which can create an optimum timetable according to the preferences of both faculties and students without any clashes and also take into account various aspects like making class timings continuous for the majority, suggest time change of any subject if timing clash can not be avoided etc.
